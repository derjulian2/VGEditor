to run the program pyside6 needs to be installed

this can be done using a virtual environment using the following commands:

python3 -m venv ./venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip3 install pyside6

for this you need the python3-venv and python3-pip packages

always use the .gitignore file as it excludes any venv folders
